Assignment 7.2
Problem Statement: We have employee_details and employee_expenses files. Use local mode while running Pig and
write Pig Latin script to get below results:

(a) Top 5 employees (employee id and employee name) with highest rating.
(In case two employees have same rating, employee with name coming first in dictionary
should get preference)

Answer: Below are the scripts.
ed = load 'employee_details.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (empid:int,empname:chararray,salary:double,rating:int);
toprat = order ed by rating asc,empname asc;
emp_top_rat = foreach toprat generate empid,empname,rating;
top5_rat = limit emp_top_rat 5;
dump top5_rat;
store top5_rat into 'asg7_1_a' using PigStorage('|');

(b) Top 3 employees (employee id and employee name) with highest salary, whose employee id
is an odd number.
(In case two employees have same salary, employee with name coming first in dictionary
should get preference)

Answer: Below are the scripts.
ed = load 'employee_details.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (empid:int,empname:chararray,salary:double,rating:int);
split ed into emp_list_odd if empid % 2 == 1, emp_list_even if empid % 2 == 0;
emp_sal_order = order emp_list_odd by salary desc,empname asc;
emp_sal_odd = foreach emp_sal_order generate empid, empname,salary;
emp_top3_sal = limit emp_sal_odd 3;
store emp_top3_sal into 'asg7_1_b' using PigStorage('|');

(c) Employee (employee id and employee name) with maximum expense
(In case two employees have same expense, employee with name coming first in dictionary
should get preference)

Answer: Below are the scripts.
ed = load 'employee_details.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (empid:int,empname:chararray,salary:double,rating:int);
ee = load 'employee_expenses.txt' as (empid:int,expense:double);
ecj = cogroup ed by empid,ee by empid;
emp_exp_sum = foreach ecj generate group as empid, SUM(ee.expense) as tot_exp;
emp_exp_list = join ed by empid left, emp_exp_sum by empid;
emp_exp_ord = order emp_exp_list by tot_exp desc,empname asc;
emp_max_tmp = foreach emp_exp_ord generate ed::empid, ed::empname,emp_exp_sum::tot_exp;
emp_max_exp = LIMIT emp_max_tmp 1;
store emp_max_exp into 'asg7_1_c' using PigStorage('|');

(d) List of employees (employee id and employee name) having entries in employee_expenses
file.
Answer: Below are the scripts.
ed = load 'employee_details.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (empid:int,empname:chararray,salary:double,rating:int);
ee = load 'employee_expenses.txt' as (empid:int,expense:double);
emp_join = join ee by empid left,ed by empid;
emp_exp_ent = foreach emp_join generate ee::empid, ed::empname;
emp_exp_list_only = DISTINCT emp_exp_ent;
dump emp_exp_list_only;
store emp_exp_list_only into 'asg7_1_d' using PigStorage('|');

(e) List of employees (employee id and employee name) having no entry in employee_expenses
file.
Answer: Below are the scripts.
ed = load 'employee_details.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (empid:int,empname:chararray,salary:double,rating:int);
ee = load 'employee_expenses.txt' as (empid:int,expense:double);
empjoin = join ed by empid full, ee by empid;
noexp = filter empjoin by ee:expense is null;
noexp_list = foreach noexp generate ed::empid, ed::empname,ee::expense;
store noexp_list into 'asg7_1_e' using PigStorage('|');
